# Getting Started


1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ASHWANI-YADAV-9450/Assesment.git

```
2. **Install dependencies:**

 ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Start the application:**

    ```bash
    npm start || nodemon app.js
    ```

4. ** Testing the API **

I have attached a Postman collection file (`Assesment.postman_collection`) that you can use to test the API.


5. ** Information about shareNotes api **

Share a specific note by providing the note's ID as a parameter (`:id`) and the user ID to share with (`sharedUserId`) in the request body.
